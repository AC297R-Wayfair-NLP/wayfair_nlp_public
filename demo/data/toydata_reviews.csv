Absolutely thrilled about these.  They are so nicely made I can't wait to get Christmas dining room table set up! Great buy,1,A,2018
They were nice but too big for my area that I needed it for,1,B,2018
I returned this item the item was not the problem after my recent  move I no longer needed it.,1,C,2017
Awful! Sending back. Doesn’t even look close to this. Very cheap looking.,1,D,2018
"There was no replacement bulb as advertised. While the light might be dimmable, you would have to buy an additional dimmer control. It does not emit as much light as the watt rating suggests it would.",1,E,2017
Nice design and quality but really small. I wasn't able to place 8 of the standard size plates on the bottom part of the shelf. Returning,1,F,2018
I love this rug but I am allergic to it.,1,G,2018
Love the shape but the branches' texture and color look too fake. We returned.,1,H,2017
"Pretty, durable, the perfect addition to our kitchen.",1,I,2018
This table is absolutely beautiful!  It ended up being a little taller then I needed so I had to return it.  But I really just loved it and really wished it would have worked in my space.  Easy to put together and a sturdy solid piece.  I would highly recommend.,1,J,2018
This couch isn't white. It's cream.,1,A,2017
"Mattress came folded in a box , not what I was expecting. I tried to return it and the returning process was a big nightmare, I had to paid almost $70 for the return , and I'm still waiting for my refund .",1,B,2018
Great fabric.  My chairs wrong design for this pillow.  Slipped forward. Wicker-type lip on the front of seat.  Back legs curved.  Couldn't tie tightly.,1,C,2018
"Great for outdoors but I ended up returning them because they say online, on the box, and on the instructions that they are good for indoors, but also say they can not be hung from the ceiling nor can they be close to the wall, which eliminates indoor use. I was very disappointed.",1,D,2017
Lightweight and cheery. A nice add for a pop of pattern.,1,E,2017
Client was happy!,1,F,2018
Amazing customer service,1,G,2017
"Well built, easy to hang. looks great above 2 hanging tiffany glass panels we also purchased from Wayfair.",1,H,2017
"From the photo, it appears to be tufted. But in fact there is no button in the center, just a criss-cross of white thread stitching. It looks like a button is missing. The white thread colour does not go with the purples and blues, looks cheap and unfinished. Filling is very, very soft so you sink into the center of the pillow with the sides coming up around you.  Colors are lovely but, all in all, way overiced imo.",1,I,2017
Beautiful and as pictured.,1,J,2017
I think that some of your rugs are not of good quality.  I have ordered rugs from Wayfair that was just not well made and I returned it.,1,A,2017
horrible and way over priced,1,B,2018
It was a lot more cherry wood than the picture shows. Had to return it since it didn't match my sons room.,1,C,2017
"Although the shape and color are nice, the lamp is so lightweight that I feel the slightest bump to the table will cause it to fall over. If you were reaching to turn it on in the dark it would be a disaster!",1,D,2017
"Beautiful rug, but I was disappointed because the color is a faded red, not bright red like the picture.  As I wanted a bright red and white rug, I am returning it.",1,E,2018
"Though I had problems with two of the 4 sinks I orders. I am still giving these sinks 5 stars. Two arrived with a flat/unfinished dark brown bottom and the other two arrived with shiny black bottom. Wayfair send me replacements right away with and the new ones are perfect. I love that they have the look of a vessel sink, but are mounted partially below the counter allowing for better faucet fit and ease of use. I was a new Wayfair customer, but am now a loyal customer because I can order with confidence that they stand behind their products.",1,F,2018
"While the colors are the same - this is not a watercolor as the other curtains I purchased at the same time are.  It appears to be a photograph that is enlarged so much, it is hard to make out the flowers - they are blurred.  There are no centers in the flowers of the curtain I received - just a dark blur.  I am returning this one.",1,G,2017
"It's a decent piece, sturdy and good quality but just looks a bit too fake for what we were going for.",1,H,2017
Too small for my king bed.,1,I,2018
"LOVE this rug.  I am exchanging for a larger size, but it's well-made, not scratchy and the perfect style for our home.",1,J,2017
"I sent this back.  Just not what I needed,",1,A,2017
size listed on website was incorrect--I could not use it,1,B,2018
"Omg these quilts are so hard feels like cardboard DO not purchase I will b returning. The print is nice, but they need to remake these.",1,C,2017
"Dimensions are not accurate.  Much larger than I needed.  Measures over 10""around and about 13"" tall",1,D,2017
"Gorgeous! Compliments and adds style to my living room or any room for that matter. I plan on buying a second lamp when the price reduces, well worth what I spent!!!!",1,E,2017
"Nice light, very modern",1,F,2018
Looks like the photo but it's a small very plastic type light weight. Not something you'd see at home goods on the floral shop,1,G,2018
I did not expect the wide and short look for the pendant. I plan to return these for a more slender light fixture.,1,H,2017
They looked nothing like the picture listed to sell the product. Truely disappointed!,1,I,2018
Exactly what I wanted. Mugs are larger than they look which works out great for our family.,1,J,2018
I liked the tables but the chrome did not look nice in my room.,1,A,2018
Unfortunately have to return the cover as it does not fit my canterlevered umbrella. Product looks nice,1,B,2018
Very nice! Will go great with my collection.,1,C,2018
I absolutely adore the look of this. I got it to place at the bottom of my coffee table but I’m still deciding if the colour is too dull.,1,D,2017
Opened and installed.  Looks GREAT!,1,E,2018
The grey is lighter and the white is more like antique white in person.,1,F,2017
I love my Fiesta Ware bowls! The color is so vibrant and pretty!,1,G,2017
they came well packaged and the product looks great,1,H,2017
Not good materials,1,I,2017
Too expensive for just the table. Thought it was a set. Very disappointed.,1,J,2018
The seat height is low for our table. The chairs are very light and feel a bit cheap. They would be good if you didnt need to use them very often.,1,A,2017
nice looking.  not sure how you are supposed to attach cushions to base,1,B,2018
not sturdy enough,1,C,2018
These would be perfect to shade house; good neutral color.,1,D,2018
Love these array of colors!,1,E,2017
Instructions said you only need a screwdriver but item arrived without holes in seat. Cannot assemble without a drill.,1,F,2018
The light is very attractive. The one critique is the tiny screws that remove the cap are underneath instead of on top as usual. I keep dropping them trying to attach the cap. This is going to be a problem when changing a bulb,1,G,2017
"I was totally dissapointed in this piece of junk. I can,t return it because i used it three times and trashed the box. All the photos I saw of golden french fries and crispy fried chicken were totally photo shopped. Everything came out greyish and looked horrible. This is my first bad experience with Wayfair and probably my last. Since I can,t return it i'm going to try and get a dollar for it at a garage sale.",1,H,2018
"Beautiful colors on the one side, white on the other.  The white side makes it look very cheap.  Beautiful softness however.",1,I,2018
"The worst thing to assemble.
I am sending it back",1,J,2017
he's are very cool modern and tables good price,1,A,2018
"Design is cool, but material is awful - cheap, shiny plastic.  I will be returning these.",1,B,2017
"The comforter as show on the pic not even close for a King size bed; very disappointed on this, it did not even come down to the sides of the mattress, review your description dimensions or pics to show what the comforter will actually cover",1,C,2017
We really like this rug - good design & feel. Only critique - the green is less of a thyme/olive color and more of a green teal.,1,D,2018
okay,1,E,2017
"Ordered 2 of these and they came in just days! They are beautiful, better looking then in the picture and anything I've seen in the local stores . So excited!",1,F,2017
Great quality and price!  Arrived quickly as well.,1,G,2017
A bit thin but good value,1,H,2018
"Horrible! This rug looks absolutely nothing like it does in any of the photos. The quality is terrible, I didn't even know they made rugs this poorly. Paper thin, when you walk on it it feels horrible. I purchased a few rugs in this purchase, each and every one was poor quality, none of the colors matched the photos. I will be shipping all of these poorly crafted, cheap, tacky rugs back. Lesson learned, there are just some things you need to touch and feel before purchasing, rugs from Wayfair being one of them. False advertising for sure.",1,I,2018
Very comfortable chair.  Sturdy and good looking too.,1,J,2017
"Nice size, comfy and soft.  Ordered pink and not blush as I was expecting - more baby pink.  Perfect if that is what you're looking for.  Going to order the ivory in replacement.",1,A,2017
"I ordered this in lavender. Love the look and style, just wish it were a tad larger because it is really a pretty chair, hence the four stars.",1,B,2017
Too shiny for my taste,1,C,2018
"no me sirve para mi love seat,,no pedi chair",1,D,2017
"Quality and style is great! I love it. Unfortunately my cat doesn't seem crazy about it. He sat in the bottom shelf for a couple minutes, but when he jumped into and out of the top shelf it almost fell over (he's about 11 pounds). He hasn't looked at it since.",1,E,2018
"Got three gray ones.  Perfect color, nice fabric and quality. Mine came with inserts. The green was hunter green, which I didn't want.",1,F,2018
"I thought it was a very beautiful piece, but I have to return it because the color doesn't go with my room. It was very well made and I wished it would of worked.",1,G,2017
"Take in the light well, but on the cheaper side.  Wasn't thrilled with the colors.",1,H,2018
LOVE THE PILLOW! GREAT STYLE WHILE MAINTAINING SIMPLICITY,1,I,2018
Wasn't the right color.,1,J,2017
"The texture and appearance of these are very nice.  BUT, they really are not 'semi-sheer' in my opinion.  They block a lot of light.",1,A,2018
Too small and then they charge a ridiculous amount of money to return ($13).,1,B,2017
"Very dissapointed! I didnt look at the messurments! Who would think you need to make sure its a standard fireplace size! I think they should mention the size a little more in the ad.  But they were very understanding and made it very easy for me to return it
Thanks",1,C,2017
Returned as I did not like the style after I received them.  Good price though.,1,D,2017
Excellent!,1,E,2017
Picture is nothing like the color of the actual table.,1,F,2017
Looks great on my mantel,1,G,2018
These were very poor quality and had a huge seam down the middle of them. I will be sending back,1,H,2017
The pillow is very pretty but I would have like a more distinctive carousel.,1,I,2018
"Wish I would have read some of the lower reviews first - If you want that shiny brass/gold look as the first 2 current pictures (attached here for context) on the product description indicate this is NOT your end table. Definitely arrives looking more ""taupe"" and MUTED as others have said.",1,J,2017
it isnt the color In the pictures online.more a green and yellow color I liked the aqua color not this color  .,1,A,2017
"Nice solid sofa, also very stylish.",1,B,2017
"The colors are much darker than shown in the photo.  The rug is about 90% dark blue and turquoise, with very little white, and definitely not the beachy colors they appear to be.  The quality seems OK.  I lost $25 on the return, so not very pleased with this purchase!",1,C,2017
Adds elegance to kitchen.,1,D,2017
Love it,1,E,2017
"The light is cool, kind of retro-mod looking. Shipping was fast!
Unfortunately we'll have to return because it doesn't quite work with our space, but it certainly is a cool fixture for somebody!",1,F,2017
The design of this accessory set is unique. If your wall is painted off white or beige or cream this color  will not popped out. I find the design simple yet elegant.,1,G,2018
Beautiful rug and very nicely made,1,H,2018
Absolutely beautiful!,1,I,2017
"Stools are really nice, but they say bar stool but they are counter height.  They also sent the wrong color twice, description says green and it was blue.  We ended up keeping the blue ones because we needed them for an opening.",1,J,2018
This lamp is very flimsy.  Beautiful but not good quality.  Returning it,1,A,2018
I love these chairs. We bought the green color and I couldn't be happier with them.,1,B,2017
Small and plastic. Really bad looking.,1,C,2017
"The picture on the website is NOT the same as the actual.  I recieved the shipment today and it's actually green and brown with a splash of blue; not blue, gray and charcoal as shown in the picture.  Looks nice if those colors match your bathroom though!",1,D,2018
"The gold looks cheap and very ""bright"" gold. I was looking for more of a brass look.",1,E,2017
"great quality, very comfortable",1,F,2017
"It has a bit of a rough texture.  It is pretty but it isn't very soft to the feel.  Other than that, it is a pretty rug and the colors are a bit more pronounced than in the picture.",1,G,2018
Is very pretty in my sewing room.,1,H,2017
"It's a great looking table, but seems overpriced.",1,I,2017
Ordered both light gray and white mica because I didn't know what would look best in my room. Liked them both but went with white mica.,1,J,2017
"This vacuum is to big to fit under most furniture, If you have carpet or rugs in your home it will not go over them.  Although this vacuum did put up some pet hair i still had to do a-lot of the work myself . Not worth the money.",1,A,2017
"It was much larger than I expected and although the glass votives were nice quality, the greenery was too artificial looking for the price.",1,B,2017
"The curtain panels were lovely- I really liked the ruffles. However, they were just too sheer for my bedroom windows.",1,C,2017
Misleading information. The headboard comes separate. Nowhere did they inform me of this. Not happy!,1,D,2018
The curtain is the perfect color I've been searching for.  The material is ideal and the holiday theme is awesome.,1,E,2018
I love my headboard! Best of all was the price and free shipping!,1,F,2018
"Cheap piece, very disappointed. Missing the hanging components and The frame is flimsy, not made of wood and no glass just plexiglass.",1,G,2017
Color more orange than rose.  Pillow cases did not fit queen size pillow by any means. I am aware it was full/queen size.  Disappointed customer.,1,H,2017
"Very pretty sheets, my daughter will love them.  Didn't realize the fabric would be quite so slippery though.",1,I,2017
Love this quilt. It brightens my bedroom!,1,J,2018
This is a quality bed set.  It looks lovely with our 18th Century mahogany reproduction furniture.,1,A,2018
Packing was terrible-it was flat upon receipt-not rolled/supported.  Buyer beware if you decide to order this item-it is being returned immediately.,1,B,2018
Very disappointed. Shelves were plastic (and looked it as well) .... will be returning,1,C,2018
This chair is very short and small.  Looked tiny in my living room.,1,D,2017
I received a similar product but with brass nail heads and no metal foot rest. I will be returning. Total disappointment.,1,E,2018
Great,1,F,2017
Horribly manufactured and the fabric was dingy and looked dirty-would not recommend to anyone.  We were very disappointed and will be returning them.,1,G,2018
Seemed a different shade than the picture and didn’t match my decor.,1,H,2018
I like the table. It's beautiful. I also love the bench. I did not receive the chairs pictured.,1,I,2018
Great delivery timing.,1,J,2017
My light was only shipped with the top half and no tripod stand.,1,A,2017
It was a very pretty set but I felt that the item was poor quality for the price :/,1,B,2018
"I am very diappointed, it is much thinner than expected, no way .5 inch. Color is not as gold as appears in photo. Fast delivery, but not what I really wanted.",1,C,2018
"These chairs are a practical and contemporary design, moderately easy to put together and work perfectly in our craft/workroom.  They are sturdy and comfortable.",1,D,2018
Bought this for my 9 year old daughters room.  Looks nice with her light aqua wall color.,1,E,2017
I love the lamp shade but it's tiny.  I'm returning it for a bigger size.,1,F,2017
Absolutly gorgous chairs and very great quality!,1,G,2017
"Good quality, my daughter really loved the vanilla oak!",1,H,2017
The rug is very soft and the colors are vibrant. Still trying to curl up a couple of week after it arrived. Doesn’t shed.,1,I,2017
"The description of this cover wasn't a good one, so I had assumed that it had gold tones in the material, but it is green, and slightly brown.  I will be returning them today.",1,J,2018
It was hard to put together but a nice piece once it came together.,1,A,2018
"Nice, I have it hung up in my office and think I like it for now :)",1,B,2018
The lamp is nice and easy to put together. It would be nice if it was just a little taller but it gets the job done.,1,C,2018
Love them! They look very fancy. Color true to website. Excellent purchase.,1,D,2017
I love this print.  I had to return it for a larger size.  Can't wait till it arrives.,1,E,2018
Awesome,1,F,2018
"This pillow feels kind of cheap in person.  The fill is insubstantial, and the finish is flat and a boring.",1,G,2017
"Color was not exactly what I wanted, but overall, very comfortable for lounging and sleeping",1,H,2017
this was a horrible selection.  It looks way too cheap.  The legs were missing also.  I'm sure wayfair would have sent them out if we wanted to keep this item but we don't,1,I,2017
The rug is really nice and of high quality.  The grey boarder has a green hint to it so it works perfectly with a room that is green/sage. Had a lot of trouble receiving the correct rug but on the third attempt it all worked out.,1,J,2018
A little thinner than expected. But in general the quality is good. The sheet set stands the wash very well. Won't complain for the price.,1,A,2017
Very nice sheet set.  Great color and sheen.  Fits nicely.,1,B,2018
"Description was a little misleading. The reverse side of the comforter along with the decorative pillows are actually a dark brown color, not dark grey/black like I was expecting. Good size and quality though. Sad to send it back.",1,C,2018
"They are too small to use for dinner plates, unless your a child",1,D,2017
Bright chrome ordered. Some small defects on chrome but I am picky. Solidly built. Presents as shown. I believe the size will be attractive to customers who desire a fixture that is not oversized in a smallish bath.,1,E,2018
I am sadly disappointed with the color.  I thought the gray was more of a gun metal gray or a tint of blue gray from the photo.  It is definitely sidewalk gray.  Pretty but not in that color for me. I will have to return it.,1,F,2017
It was a good product...I sent it back because I decided not to redo sunroom...,1,G,2017
"Sturdy and easy to put together. The ""wood"" finish on the shelves looks a little cheap, but over all it is a good piece for the price.",1,H,2017
"I ordered two sets of dark indigo blue and could not be more disappointed.  They are NOTHING like the picture.  Very poor quality fabric, faded with poor workmanship. I would be afraid to wash in machine.  Promptly returned.",1,I,2017
"This chair is so cute, but it just didn't work for our office. We planned to use these for a raised-desk at a busy office and determined these just weren't sturdy enough at their tallest. We went with a stool with 4 legs. These did arrive in great shape and were easy to assemble.",1,J,2018
great bronze color...very sturdy,1,A,2018
It's great.,1,B,2017
The material is very nice quality and a pretty slate blue gray. Assembly was super easy. Unfortunately it didn't work for my needs because it was just way to small and low to the ground for practical use. This was my fault because I didn't read the dimensions carefully. If you're looking for something small that folds down easily this may be for you.,1,C,2017
Color was not vibrant as shown online.  I returned the product.,1,D,2017
Beautifully made,1,E,2018
Nice Stand,1,F,2018
"The fixture is beautiful but the glass shades are amber colored, NOT clear as pictured. Bought two and one is worse than the other.",1,G,2018
Was very unhappy with color of glass,1,H,2017
The color was different than pictured.,1,I,2017
Excellent product,1,J,2017
Rug was a bit thin but of good quality. Perfect compliment to any room.,1,A,2017
Definitely not worth the price.,1,B,2017
"Not what I wanted. Looks fake,  cheap and stiff. I will return it.",1,C,2017
very nice comfy rug,1,D,2017
"Great for any drapery or curtain window treatment.  If you are using heavy drapery, you may want to go with the larger medallion that is also offered on this site.",1,E,2017
"Love the pillow, the design and quality are great....but definitely darker, bit more dull of an orange than pictured. Erin Gates has such a great line, other than the delayed shipping, I have been really happy with her items. Looks like I spent $$$$$, but it was only like $40!",1,F,2018
Gorgeous colors.,1,G,2017
"Color nothing like what was shown in pictures. I was expecting a rich purple like the photo shows, but it's a light lavender color in person.",1,H,2018
Web site did not say these sheets were flannel...Very disappointed with these sheets...I am returning them...Web site stated 100% Cotton..!!,1,I,2018
Great quality! low pile and beautiful vibrant color!,1,J,2018
awful.  it appears silvery white in most lighting.  poor description given by wayfair,1,A,2017
This is really cheap looking-it is made  out of peg board material with label glued on. Not worth the money!,1,B,2017
Just what I needed to upgrade my old cabinets! Love the look and the price!,1,C,2017
Was very disappointed with this purchase. The removable part of the pit was not 17 inches deep as advertised it was only 7 inches deep; so please note.,1,D,2018
Love this rug. Unfortunately have to return it for the larger 8 foot size.,1,E,2017
"The Peacock area rug is beautiful, but I thought the darker color was navy and it turns out it was black.  So, may need to return it, but I really like it.  The quality is very good, as well.",1,F,2018
So pretty,1,G,2017
"The color and pattern of this rug is beautiful.  It is thin so it rolls flat quickly and needs a pad.  My only problem is it is very scratchy and uncomfortable to sit on when playing with my children.  My three year old described it as ""very pokey""... the three stars were chosen as comfort and function are very important for my use.  The color is definitely a medium blue with NO hint of gray (which my computer screen showed), still a pretty color. If it were soft I would be in love with it!",1,H,2018
Looks great in my lamp post. Plenty of lights throughout the garland.,1,I,2018
AAAAAAA+++++++,1,J,2018
Very nice but too much color for my decor.,1,A,2018
Beautiful rug.  Glad I found it on Wayfair.  Was about to pay $300 at a furniture store.  Was half the price at Wayfair.,1,B,2018
Nice looking.  Clean line glam.,1,C,2018
Beautiful set but had to return it because we got a futon for the room instead.,1,D,2017
prettier then ikea better quality,1,E,2018
"never will buy again thru Wayfair. they show as 5*8 and when you put it on your cart, is a different size.
plus if you return it, you have to pay the shipping.
i keep with Amazon!",1,F,2018
Beautiful,1,G,2018
Very cute,1,H,2018
It's very nice and has many features especially it covers the track so you cannot see mounting screws,1,I,2018
"The detail on this knob! Ordered it in the distressed nickel finish, which helped to give the design a lot of definition. A bit smaller than I would have liked, but fine quality.",1,J,2018
"Table was nice and solid, but the top has grooves running the width of the table that weren't clear in the pictures.  I would love to keep it, but will be returning this due to those grooves.",1,A,2017
Not what I thought must be plugged  in with a USB cord did not like,1,B,2017
"Love this rug! It came exactly as pictured. I have it under our table in the morning room and even though it catches a lot of crumbs at dinner time, it is super easy to clean. Highly recommend.",1,C,2018
"We originally purchased them for above the kitchen island, but they are too small for the space.  We will use them in the powder bath where the size is more appropriate.

Quality is very good, and they look exactly as shown.",1,D,2018
"This was my first time buying from Wayfair and it was a great experience overall! We ordered two sets of bar stools that were in the open box section, so they'd been previously purchased and then returned. When they arrived, one set was a little scraped up because the previous purchaser must've thrown out the packaging and had to use a towel to repackage it, but they're meant to look rustic so that didn't bother us - I mean, they were also half off so that worked for me. The second set was the wrong size, but we just contact the folks at Wayfair via the chat feature and as soon as we explained the issue they sent us new stools! It's honestly been the easiest return/exchange I've ever gone through AND I love my bar stools. Thanks Wayfair!",1,E,2017
I like this a lot. Smallest size was a little too small for my pug though. I might order the next size up.,1,F,2018
Great little rings. Nice clamp strength.,1,G,2018
Comfy comfy comfy. Love this pillow so much. Squishy but yet still supportive for my neck and not hot at all.,1,H,2018
Not loving them.  Get what you pay for,1,I,2017
It's nice but didn't fit my chairs,1,J,2018
"Need to return. It's uncomfortable, too dark and too short.",1,A,2017
Like it...just didn't fit,1,B,2018
I am giving these one star because they are so pretty. I wanted smaller appetizer plates and thought 4 inches would work. However these are curved up and look more like a tiny finger bowl. Way to small. Will be returning. Wish they came larger.,1,C,2017
"I absolutely love this piece of furniture!  It took me 2.5 hours to assemble by myself, the hardware was very organized and the directions were easy to follow.  It's the perfect addition to my flex/TV room.",1,D,2017
"Quality wise, it was very nice. It would have been nice to know that what looked to be dark grey in the photo was really dark green! I spent two days repainting my bedroom in two tones of grey in anticipation of it's arrival and was very disappointed. Have to pack it up and send it back.",1,E,2018
for  1000 count sheets I expected a smooth soft sheet. When I opened the sheet package they seemed rough so I washed them using fabric softener and they came from my dryer very wrinkled and rough like cheap sheets. I bought 3 sets and returned two and wish I had not washed the 1st one so I could have returned it also.,1,F,2018
Cheap plastic.  Price was too high for something like this.  Clips also did not fit the furniture as suggested.,1,G,2017
Great for the price!,1,H,2018
"This is a very cheap looking rug and was very thin, for the price I would not recommend this rug.",1,I,2018
Wrong team. I need to return but this is a better chair than in the store.,1,J,2018
Awesome! Just exactly as described and exactly what I needed for my space. The baskets are super flexible but very durable at the same time.,1,A,2017
"It looks black and white in the picture. However, it’s definitely black & tan.",1,B,2018
These are gorgeous! I love the greywash color. I ordered 4 of these and one came broken. I'm giving it 4 stars because it seemed the chair leg was broken from the wood being a bit rotten. Wayfair is sending a new one.,1,C,2018
Does not fit as indicated in photo displayed,1,D,2017
Make sure you order the right valve for the faucet. I suggest calling Kohler or your plumber. Had to send this back and order the right one.,1,E,2018
"The size and shape was exactly what I wanted, however the color was way off. Described as blush and in reality was lilac/lavender. Truly purple, not pink.
Despite this error, Wayfair deducts $50 for return pickup. Not worth shopping on this site unless you’ve already seen the item in person.",1,F,2018
Table was ok. Crackled glass is not actually the glass.,1,G,2018
Got3 for different beds the gray and turquoise were beautiful but I didn’t like the burgundy and I’m sending it back,1,H,2017
It was for my daughter and she had trouble pouring out of it so sadly I am returning  the blender,1,I,2018
I am returning. Color much too hunter green,1,J,2017
"I have a chair from here that is beige and linen material, I ordered this ottoman to match. The ottoman is a completely different color from the chair and I am very disappointed. Trying to return it however now they are asking me to pay my shipping costs even though the item wasn't as described on the website.",1,A,2017
very elegant and well designed!,1,B,2018
Love it. Good quality!,1,C,2018
Love that it came exactly what it looked like online.  Good quality!,1,D,2018
Darker then in picture!,1,E,2018
Good buy,1,F,2018
"Larger than anticipated based on specifications and item description. Base was not quite glass but seemed to be a more plastic-glass blend. Bottom ring seemed cheap. Just was not happy, expected it to be nicer so I am returning.",1,G,2017
Love it!,1,H,2017
"This fixture was exactly what I expected. However, the glass was hard to place. If you purchase this, be sure to put the large pieces of glass in first. Overall, looks gorgeous on the house.",1,I,2018
"The insert is very soft, and lightweight as I wanted it for hot weather. Unfortunately, it is very small on my queen duvet cover. Will be returning.",1,J,2018
AWESOME CHAIRS.  More on the petite size yet firm cushion & great structure.  :),1,A,2017
Beautiful Item true to picture,1,B,2017
Love the look!,1,C,2017
Not sturdy enough,1,D,2017
Thought it would be more “white-ish” but was very cream (yellowish) ... returning it but the rug is very thick and heavy so if the colors work it would be good.,1,E,2017
Love these sheets,1,F,2017
"Sleek, good quality, excellent value. Comes well-packaged.",1,G,2017
the chairs didn't look good in my space,1,H,2017
Comfortable wish it was a complete,1,I,2017
"I did not realize the actual ""mirror"" part was not made of mirror material, but rather some sort of plastic that makes the reflection look like some sort of distorted fun house image.  Maybe I should have figured that's what I'd get for the price.",1,J,2017
Absolutely stunning--however- the color is deceiving- I ordered the french gold and it looks mores silver./olive/bit of gold.....but it looks good and I decided to keep it!,1,A,2018
"Good quality, but didn't fit my décor.",1,B,2017
"I was about to return this when it first felt like too soft compared to the other memory foam pillow I got but, after sleeping on it one night like a baby I know this is a great pillow for a stomach-sleeper like but, should work well for others w/o too broad a shoulder if you are a side-sleeper.",1,C,2018
"Easy to install, but the quality of the fabric wasn't quite what I was hoping for as it looks a little cheap. Still, it's a keeper.",1,D,2017
Fits the space perfectly. Very cozy and comfortable. I love it!!,1,E,2018
Just another satisfied customer with what I've gotten from Wayfare,1,F,2017
"Not the color shown. A ""WHITE"" and silver. Poor workmanship. Returning. Very Disappointed.",1,G,2018
I returned this item....it appeared to be made very cheap and for the cost....was not a good purchase for me.,1,H,2017
They are perfect.  Good quality!,1,I,2018
"Excellent service, received promptly. This faucet is beautiful and exactly as described. I've been telling everyone about Wayfair. Great products and at the right price points!",1,J,2018
"Perfect, and so soft!",1,A,2017
I was really disappointed when I opened the box to see cheap looking veneer and a very grey looking wood color.  Totally not what I was expecting.  Will have to return.,1,B,2018
very pretty,1,C,2018
"Lamps are beautiful, just didn't work with colors in our room.  Shade has a beautiful shimmer to it",1,D,2018
Perfect! Exactly as pictured!,1,E,2017
"This is a beautiful lamp!  Sadly, the bulbs show below the shade and cast a very bright and glaring light.  I had to return them.",1,F,2017
"I made the mistake of only ordering the base instead of the full hall tree. The base itself is beautiful, however since I cannot buy the mirror separately, I will have to return it, as the base by itself doesn't fit my need of additional storage space for my coats and handbags.",1,G,2017
The quality of this pillow is not acceptable to put in a guest room!  It looks like it's made out of cheap $5 material.  I returned it.,1,H,2017
very nice chairs -- comfortable and easy to assemble,1,I,2017
The white background is pretty dingy- it looks dirty. Much more lackluster than in the photo.,1,J,2017
Super thin and cheap looking. I will not be purchasing rugs through Wayfair again simply because you can't tell the quality you're getting until you roll the rug out.,1,A,2017
I love the print but I guess maybe my decor was not eclectic or bohemian enough for it to fit.,1,B,2017
Nice look but color of wood was not expected- too big for area,1,C,2018
Extremely cheap.  A piece of junk.,1,D,2017
The weight is authentic but the paint job makes them look very fake. I'm returning them.,1,E,2017
"Not so much, missed the mark for me.  Very sparse, lots of areas where the trunk shows through.  I realize this is supposed to almost be a Charlie Brown tree but this just didn't cut it for me.",1,F,2017
Really cute to add a pop of color on my patio sectional. Kind of small though,1,G,2018
not the color pink described,1,H,2017
very nice super fast delivery,1,I,2018
This light comes without the light bulbs and they are almost impossible to find and the ones I way too expensive!,1,J,2017
I love the lampshades. Not actually crazy about the actual lamp base. Looks like a lot of paint over paint and one of the désign on the base is not straight with the base. Debatable if I am keeping.,1,A,2017
great price!!,1,B,2017
"Tapestry is very beautiful, thick, great colors. I gave previously a bad review because I thought that the colors were not red as described. And what happened is that they had sent me a wrong tapestry. It is very similar but orange. I returned it and finally they brought me the Luchon Terrasse, which is exactly what I needed. Great addition to my formal dining room
The only thing I didnt like so much is that it came folded and it is difficult to take the marks off",1,C,2017
I was so glad to get the bed frame It got hear when promised,1,D,2018
These pillows were very faded and did not look as good as on the web site.  Also they were smaller.  The pillows were very lumpy.,1,E,2018
Looks cheap,1,F,2018
Really nice quality for a good price. We are very happy with the functionality. Will be ordering more.,1,G,2018
"Sofa is GREAT! perfect for our needs. Its stylish, modern, and comfortable. Best part is it converts into a bed for my kiddos to nap during late work nights at the studio!",1,H,2017
Ordered these in Ant. English. Large Appliance Pulls so hard to find. LOVE these. Style is unique indie feel yet  very transitional. I used a mix of other hardware styles from country/rustic to the classic egg shape knob and its gorgeous. I highly recommend these!!,1,I,2018
quality was horrible- returning!,1,J,2018
This is a combination of a window shade and curtain. Love the look and it will keep out the heat this summer! Nicely made and looks like the picture.,1,A,2018
Great quality!,1,B,2018
"First i would like to thank wayfair for  making it so easy for a dad, grandpa and great grandpa a way to shop for my big family without haveing to leave my home.bought this for my great grandaughter, and got a call from her last night that she loves it, how did i know what she might like. I told i may be 83 but still know how to make a beautiful young lady happy, ( her mom told me). So this mirror got a big thumbs up, she said she loves it.
Thank you wayfair for having so many different things to pick from for those special accusations, when an old man like me that cant get out much anymore, but now can buy  for the whole familly
Sincerely your biggest fan.",1,C,2017
Great price and the quality was good. The colors just looked a bit drab in person versus online.,1,D,2018
Too small/narrow,1,E,2018
These are pretty but I didn't love the feel of the fabric.,1,F,2018
The cart is spacious and very sturdy. It folds up very compactly.,1,G,2017
Beautiful!,1,H,2017
"These pillows are totally deceiving. They look like they will be covered in sequins, but it is screen printed on canvas.  And the screen printing looks horrible.  They are a rip-off for the price.  I will be returning.  DO NOT BUY!  They are not cute!",1,I,2018
The lamp does not work unless the light is on. Wiring must go through the switch and not individually set up.,1,J,2017
Not as advertised but called Wayfair while delivery guys were still here.  Woman on the phone was very helpful and accommodating.  We had the option to keep or return and ended up with a nice discount to keep it!  Wonderful resolution from Customer Service!,1,A,2017
these are nice and thick...seems like the hair will come off easy.  i got the wrong size but am returning for the correct ones.  bought 2.,1,B,2017
This light was purchased in the nickel and it looks beautiful!,1,C,2017
"There is no mention this is a small child's recliner. Age range 2-6 maybe? This needs to be the first part of the description, child's recliner. Small recliner does not tell you this a child's recliner. I have no use for a child's recliner.",1,D,2017
The pot did not look like the picture. I thought it would be more metallic but looked more like painted plastic which made it look cheap. Returned immediately.,1,E,2018
Thinner than I thought and the color was too pink....,1,F,2018
"This is a nice thick high quality rug; however, it sheds more than normal wool rugs.  I have taupe, grey, aqua, turquoise (blues/greens), colors throughout my home, but I can't seem to match it with anything.  It pulls the blue/green/grey colors, yet doesn't match with any of my decor despite my extreme efforts to re-decorate to make this rug work.  It may end up as a gift to friends or family, but hope the return shipping is reasonable as I bought 4.",1,G,2017
Helps keep my mattress nice and clean from disasters my daughter makes,1,H,2017
Love the colors.  Not as soft as I would prefer.,1,I,2017
"soft & cuddly.
lovely colour fades",1,J,2018
"Beautiful, but received wrong color ordered. It's a Christmas gift so it's too late to send in and wait for exchange. I am going to wait to see what she thinks of the color, but I hesitate to order from wayfar in the future.",1,A,2017
Great style!,1,B,2017
"I ordered this chair in BLUE. I waited forever for an item that said was IN STOCK. I FINALLY got it and when I opened it in was HOT PINK. So, I called Wayfair and the girl I talked to was very nice and said she would send for a pick-up and reorder it for me in BLUE. She said it would be a problem, that it was IN STOCK! I said... Great! No problem... mistakes happen. I waited for 3 weeks... And FINALLY I get the second chair only to open the box and the new chair was BRIGHT ORANGE!!!! By this time I was LIVID! This was a Christmas gift for a little boy and I really had my heart set on BLUE! I didn't have any choice but to keep it!!! I couldn't send it back because WAYFAIR NEVER PICKED UP THE 1ST ONE! I knew I'd be asking to much to pick up a second chair when they didn't pick-up the first one. The bottom line is.... I was sent to chairs I didn't order and I was charged for 2 chairs because their screw up was never corrected. I ended up donating the HOT PINK chair and I ended up giving the boy the orange chair even though it looks kind of sissy for a boy. I will continue to buy from Wayfair because I do like their products. However, if anything like this happens again.... I'm done and it will be their loss. If the chair had been sent correctly in the first place I would have given them 5 stars, but because the people working in their warehouse can't read the box or know their colors I giving them 3 stars.",1,C,2018
Really nice comfy cushions. Unfortunately they were too small for my chair seats and now I must return them,1,D,2017
"Ha! What they don't say is that the shutter is hollow with only one side, like a jello mold! They aren't real. Plus, mine was supposed to be 15"" wide, and they sent me 14 3/8"".  Bad deal!",1,E,2017
"I have been very pleased with many of my purchases from this site, and have generally found the descriptions accurate. This was not the case with these. They are VERY white, shiny, semi-sheer, and striped. Didn't work with my other items at all. If you look very closely at the image in the description, you can almost see the stripes, but they are much more obvious in person. However, the quality is great and if you are looking for very white, striped sheer curtains, these would be right up your alley.",1,F,2017
"I ordered this product by mistake and couldn't use it for the purpose that I needed. However, it was very beautiful.",1,G,2017
Just what I need. Thank you very much.,1,H,2018
Hot hard and you’ll wake up with a sore back and neck.,1,I,2017
"So cute, putting it in my laundry room.",1,J,2017
"very light , but nice",1,A,2018
Best range hood in the market for 600 cmf,1,B,2018
this was a great deal and the weight of it is perfect,1,C,2017
"I just love the curtains!
Quality is good and the color is beautiful.",1,D,2018
Great,1,E,2018
Perfect for storing toys!,1,F,2018
It's like sleeping on a cloud it conforms to your body real comfortable.,1,G,2018
Towels are thinner than described.,1,H,2018
Love it and my son love it,1,I,2018
Colors and style did not go with what I was looking for.,1,J,2017
"It's darker and more muted than pictured. While I love the style I ended up sending it back due to color. On a side note, the package came damaged....",1,A,2017
"Great for the price. Not the most comfortable chairs, but the look was perfect for what we needed.",1,B,2018
What came was not how the product was displayed here.  In order to return I need to pay more than half the cost. No good!,1,C,2018
"Excellent stools. They were actually too tall for my counter top, but I purchased the 24'' versions, and they are phenomenal!",1,D,2018
Nice piece but I was disappointed with the poor packaging. A few of the shells were damaged when I opened the box. It ended up being too large for the space that I intended it to hang. If I had another space for them I would've kept them.,1,E,2017
Trying to return it. Not the quality I expected!!,1,F,2017
Good to stage a home,1,G,2017
"Good quality, thick, perhaps the pix is a little lighter than the mat. Good addition to a kitchen, although the colors are not right for mine.",1,H,2018
"Wasn't extremely impressed with the look when it arrived. Looked very ""fake"" I thought.",1,I,2017
I was disappointed that the mug wasn't larger... it is only 9 oz and the tree print appears slightly distorted in my opinion. It just wasn't exactly what I expected. I am returning my order.,1,J,2018
It arrived within a couple of days and was exactly as described. We love it!,1,A,2018
Love it!,1,B,2017
Smaller than I expected. Didn't have the wow I expected,1,C,2018
The sconce is beautiful but I ordered the higher end crystal's when I opened the well packaged sconce to my dismay the higher end Strass crystals were not what I had ordered ... Wayfair corrected the problem and I awaiting my new sconce.. fingers crossed...,1,D,2018
Perfect for my entryway.  The style is impressive.,1,E,2018
There is no on/off switch and it is difficult to get the lamp shade on straight because of cheap manufacturing.,1,F,2018
love it,1,G,2017
Bigger than I anticipated.  A tub barrel chair.  Nice quality but too large for the area as planned.,1,H,2018
I love my fireplace. It's beautiful.  The only problem is it's lighter than the actual picture on the website and the rest of my living room furniture is dark wood. I called Wayfair and they apologized and gave me a discount because my husband had already put it together before I got home so I couldn't return it for a darker one.,1,I,2017
"Cute, but not enough wt to stay in place.",1,J,2018
"This is merely a piece of fabric that goes around the edges of the box spring and stays relatively connected (not very neatly, frankly) via an elastic band.  It's ugly and cheap and being returned today.",1,A,2018
many leaves were facing backwards and it was difficult to get them staying the forward direction,1,B,2017
Very Nice.  Would have been nice for our backyard but just won't work.,1,C,2017
"This dish rack is so beautiful and solid looking. It is full stainless steel and was simple to assemble. Unfortunately, I had to return it. The 3 tiers were just too high for the area I had available. Such a unique piece, wish it would of worked out. I am sad to see it go.",1,D,2018
"This is is an awful product! Packed in the messy messy styrofoam the base weighs over 20lbs! Edges on base are very rough and sharp-you feel like you’re cutting your hands. I didn’t fully assemble it due to the weight issue and mess, sending it back.",1,E,2017
"Very cute rug for a nursery! Not too bright so easy to match with things, but definitely still livens up the room.",1,F,2017
"These shelves are AWFUL. They're huge and bulky and I'm not sure how they would manage to stay on the wall, let alone adding any weight to them with picture frames or vases. And keep in mind if you DO order them and need to return them that they're heavy enough to cost quite a bit of money in return shipping. NOT WORTH IT.",1,G,2017
I really like this swing however I think it's really over priced for what it is.,1,H,2017
These are not the ones I wanted,1,I,2017
The comfort I expected from this Mattress Topper was not what I expected. It is very flat and feels as though there is just an extra thin blanket underneath you.,1,J,2017
Great rug pad .,1,A,2018
Cheap quality and look,1,B,2018
"Looks absolutely nothing like the photo.  Bright primary colors in person, not the jewel tones seen online.  Thought it would be an interesting visual addition to my entry way...instead I feel like I should be hosting story time in a preschool around it.  Going back immediately.",1,C,2018
This item was not what I expected for the price that I paid.,1,D,2018
Love these. Perfect navy!,1,E,2017
If you love color this is a great rug!  I would like to have an additional rug installed in another room but I need to convince my son and his wife.  They see practicality not aesthetics.,1,F,2018
"While it looks nice (and full sized) in the photos and has many positive reviews, it is very difficult to find anything positive to say about this loveseat.  I would describe this as a 2/3 scale, toy furnishing.  Unpack it, assemble it, place it in a room with an adult sized sofa and be prepared to laugh out loud.  It is suitable for spaces used by very small and responsible people only (children who can resist the urge to play with and remove the Velcro'd on upholstery or Lilliputians).  I saw one positive review where the people were using this to furnish an RV.  I can see that or using it in a playhouse/playroom situation or for anyone who's jumped on board the tiny house movement and needs equally tiny furnishings.  If any of those describe your situation, order with confidence.  I suppose I can admire the clever packaging and ease of assembly as well as the decent grade of fabric but the unmitigated disappointment I feel anytime I catch a glimpse of it in my living room far outweighs any of that.  Reviews describing the seat depth as inadequate are spot on.  Heed them.  They were not written by internet crackpots.  Average size adults are in constant danger of falling off the front of this thing.  When you pick yourself up off the floor you will then get to distract yourself from that unfortunate embarrassment by reattaching the back cushions to their Velcro fixings and reshaping the bottom cushions.  You need to do both anytime this has been sat upon.  Guests will imagine that you do not like them very much at all.  No one who lives in your home is going to want to sit on this without having lost a bet.  While it appears to be a brown with a hint of red on the monitors upon which I viewed it before ordering, it came out of the box in a delightful purple hue.  Take advantage of having fabric samples delivered before ordering.  Wayfair has so far been easy to deal with on the return.  The return policy states that you get to pay return shipping ($89 in this case).  They did provide a compromise on that I will be able to live with.  Fingers are crossed that I can repackage this thing in a manner which results in a fullish credit without the means to vacuum pack cushions into paper thin wafers.",1,G,2017
This shower curtain is ugly. Doesn't look anything like the image.,1,H,2018
"The print on canvas is much darker than the online image. This is especially true for the tree bark. You don't get as much detail in the print as the online image displays. It's too bad, because the online image looks great. Not so with the in-person print...",1,I,2018
It was alright just wont work in the place I needed it to fit. Need to return it.,1,J,2017
Extremely stunning using it to place in my bathroom over my soaker tub.  Beautiful picture.,1,A,2017
"There was nothing wrong with this set except it just didn't work in the bedroom I bought it for, so I returned it.",1,B,2018
This is the nice sink for modern bathroom,1,C,2018
"This one my husband didn't care for all of the flowers, so I returned it.",1,D,2018
Nice ottoman but did not love it for what I needed so returned it.,1,E,2018
"This rug was nice, but wasn't what I expected based on the picture and description. It said it was a shag rug, so I was expecting a rug woven with yarn-like pieces. Instead, it was knotted with strips of a papery fabric. It won't work in the room I purchased it for, so I am returning it.",1,F,2017
Very nice! The price for this piece is great! I've seen similar ottomans at other stores for almost double the price,1,G,2017
wakes up any room or space,1,H,2017
It is absolutely beatiful.  Was a bit big for my space so had to return it :-( very sad about that.,1,I,2018
"These runners are beautiful! I love the looks of them! Great quality and nice material! Not sure if they will go well in my kitchen, but I really like them!",1,J,2017
Somehow actual rug is not as bright as it looks in picture. The big design is not going well at least in my home but quality is good.,1,A,2017
Beautiful!  Looked great over the gray duvet.  Great quality.,1,B,2018
Nice chair! Goes perfectly!,1,C,2017
Color did not work out with color scheme as hoped it would.,1,D,2017
Wrong size so have to return. But bought different length and cant wait to get them. These really make the place feel so much nicer than it is.,1,E,2017
Disappointed! Did not look like the picture,1,F,2018
Love it! Really beautiful it makes a statement in my front foyer.,1,G,2017
"Elegant, refined, matched well will crystal knobs and Kohler Artifacts faucet.",1,H,2018
"Look great in our kitchen, don't stain easily, and they are very comfy!",1,I,2018
not as bright yellow as I expected more pastel,1,J,2017
great size & color!,1,A,2017
Super comfortable. My daughter is finally sleeping through the night. I'd get one for myself if I needed a new mattress.,1,B,2018
Very bright and thinner than expected.,1,C,2017
"This has a lot of brown and dark taupe tones and far less gray than depicted in the photo and written description.  Very disappointed as it looks lovely online, but that's the chance you take with online purchases.",1,D,2017
loved the color and quality. good size for my husband (tall),1,E,2017
"The rug is thin, feels a little cheap.",1,F,2018
Pretty but I found it to be very itchy material,1,G,2018
Very nice and good quality. I gave it 4 stars because I am returning this item only because the color is too dark for the room's color scheme.,1,H,2018
"Love, love, love this rug!  It is exactly what I was looking for.  It is plush and beautiful.  Our dog and two young children took to it right away (it's so comfortable to sit and lie on) and we have received so many compliments on it already, and we've had it less than a week.",1,I,2018
This is far from garland. It's just some clear plastic beads on some clear fishing wire. :(   I am putting in a return for this item.,1,J,2017
The chair is brown! It looks ivory. returning,1,A,2018
Very nice,1,B,2018
Gorgeous!!,1,C,2017
"Like the 10/17/17 reviewer, I want to note that the dimensions are totally wrong. Hopefully, that reviewer called Wayfair before returning the item to get Wayfair to pay for the shipping. This is totally their fault. The customer service person I spoke to said that they would make sure the dimensions are corrected on the site. Hopefully, that'll happen. Otherwise, these slipcovers - unlike the other reviewer, I was fine with the fabric - are useless!",1,D,2017
Its a very nice rug but what I thought would be a navy blue is actually a definite grey.,1,E,2017
The color is a beautiful greige color that goes beautifully with my greige walls and pewter oak flooring.  The shag is soft and plush and nice to walk on.  I love it so much I ordered the same style for throughout my house!,1,F,2018
"Very disappointed with this rug. The colors weren’t nearly as vibrant as pictured and when I unrolled the rug to lay it, the ends were so badly wrinkled, it was impossible to make them lie flat. The entire end of the rug is a wrinkled mess. This rug is 7x9, not exactly easy to repackage & return, therefore I’m just going to have to figure out how to make do. This wasn’t my first on line order of a rug but it is my first disappointment.",1,G,2018
Very disapointed in this product. I still had to sweep my floor even though this product has a vaccum. Steam portion didnt work well either. My floor was still dirty after I used this product,1,H,2017
"This is not a pretty rug. It looks nothing like the photo and honestly resembles bamboo. The green is NOT green, but a dark, mustard green.",1,I,2018
"They are pretty, but very heavy.",1,J,2017
The combination of colors was a perfect match for my decor.,1,A,2017
Nice bedset.,1,B,2018
Ugly in person!!! Poor quality. Sent it back.,1,C,2018
"nice chair, back and seat adjust",1,D,2017
"Misleading photo, delivery is not as shown in this picture.  The only thing you get is the table, very disappointing!! P.S. To make matters worse, I can't find these chairs anywhere. (:",1,E,2018
I'm sure these are nice sheets. But we wanted a fresh light blue and these have more grey in them. Had to return due to color.,1,F,2017
very pretty fabric...kind of light fabric though,1,G,2018
"This couch is perfect for a person of smaller stature. Personally, it is not for me. I'm 6 ft tall, 210 lbs. Beside, the sectional being extremely stiff and uncomfortable, I found it too small to sit in. There was no real depth to the couch. It reminds me of the furniture you find at a mall or university. Its there to get the job done, but doesn't invite you to stay. It doesn't have a homey feel to it. Honestly, I would spring for something better. You want your home to feel like home, not the common room of a college building. 

2 stars because the price is okay and if you don't mind the firmness, then by all means.. do you.",1,H,2017
great for my girl's room! good quality,1,I,2018
"This coverlet was awesome! The colors are just as represented online, it just didn't work with my dark wood palate wall behind the bed.",1,J,2017
"Love the look of this inflatable but there are absolutely no tabs on item to tie it down,  I live in California where Santa Ana’s will blow anything away...this item states it has tie downs but it does not.  Also no light inside to light it up...as shown in picture...a huge disappointment.  Returning the for the money spent",1,A,2018
It has sparkles in it.  Thin.  Returning.,1,B,2018
"Awful!!! Cheap quality. The seat is too short (even for me and Im 5’1”) and it is tilted towards the front, so you slide off. Returning it!",1,C,2017
Love it!,1,D,2018
Was very disappointed. I ordered a distressed wood. I got a snow white Shiney wood. I have nothing snow white. Thinks for the $30.00 credit. Juanita Kelly,1,E,2018
very poofy. cat loves it!,1,F,2018
Very pretty; I love it!,1,G,2017
Color not as stated. Item returned. Shipping cost for ridiculously. Item costed 139 returned at $98. I purchased multiple items in my order. seem like wayfair was trying obtain total shipping cost on one item returned.,1,H,2018
perfect match for our kitchen   no issues with installation,1,I,2018
This looks perfect in a foyer area.,1,J,2017
THe colors are bright like the picture. It's very thin but it is what we expected for the price.,1,A,2017
"These shelves are AWFUL. They're huge and bulky and I'm not sure how they would manage to stay on the wall, let alone adding any weight to them with picture frames or vases. And keep in mind if you DO order them and need to return them that they're heavy enough to cost quite a bit of money in return shipping. NOT WORTH IT.",1,B,2017
This chandelier is absolutely stunning. I had to return it only because it was too big for the intended space and I had no where else to put it.,1,C,2017
Was was sent the correct box and item # BUT the wrong color was inside.,1,D,2017
The sink looks good and is of a good quality,1,E,2017
"I unfortunately ordered the wrong size and had to return this, but it was a great sink at a great value.",1,F,2017
"It is a little smaller than I thought it would be.  Also the colors are a little dull.  I was going to put it on a gray wall, but I don't think it will show up very well. It might look better in the larger version.",1,G,2018
Awesome!!!,1,H,2017
"Color not as shown. I ordered the blue and shown it is a bright blue. As received it is a dark and not so bright blue. Also, it is for a window only, not over a door which is what I ordered. Have to return unfortunately.",1,I,2018
"NOT the memory foam I was hoping for.  What I wanted was one of those low-profile but fairly dense and firm pillows (what everyone thinks of in memory foam).  This thing is pretty overstuffed, kinda hurt my neck.  I'm sure all the tech is cool and useful, but it's just too big for me.",1,J,2017
Nice and extra soft!,1,A,2018
High quality rug. Very thick and beautifully made. Color is not true to photo... much more green in person.,1,B,2017
"Color received doesn’t match photo. If you are expecting a dark, espresso color don’t buy. It’s more of a light brown with gold undertones.",1,C,2018
Not soft at all and there is no pile or fluff. So thin you can see the rug framework like a little kid made it. Also very grey not cream.,1,D,2018
"Sorry, but I was disappointed in this order.  It really looked artificial!",1,E,2018
Absolute garbage. Terrible quality material and looks totally cheap. I'll be returning this.,1,F,2018

Beautiful!,1,I,2018

"Its very pretty, I love it but its too big for the space I need to put it.",1,B,2018
"The product looks great but the website has the incorrect specs for the larger shade. This is 8' wide and 6' long, not the other way around. Unfortunately for us we needed the size that the website had posted. Too bad because we love the color and the quality of the product. Thank goodness wayfair has great customer service. But I hope they change the online specs before someone makes the same mistake that we made.",1,C,2017
Beautiful light,1,D,2017
"The weight is a little light but overall, it's a nice rug",1,E,2018
The rug really disappointed me. Much darker than the picture and very thin. Trying to return but getting no response from the Company.,1,F,2017

Great piece of art for the price.  Installed onto a space above an upholstered headboard in master bedroom.,1,C,2018

We like this product as this is as beautiful as it looks in the picture. Made with sturdy material.,1,E,2018
Easy to order.  Love the light it gives off.,1,F,2018
"This works well. I only had to return it because I thought it could be used to clean carpets, but it's more of a spot treatment system for carpets.",1,G,2017
Not as nice as i thought it would be snd not quite the right colors.  I will be returning it.,1,H,2017
I ordered 3 identical navy chairs. Two arrived perfect and beautiful. One arrived in a green instead of blue,1,I,2018
"Cute, but smaller than I expected. Too small for my space.  Keep in mind that the measurements for the height of the pendant includes more than just the boxy area.  It goes all the way up to where the trusses meet the chain.",1,J,2017
Too short.,1,A,2018
"I loved the product, but the description said I could hang them either way and that isn't the case. I was compensated for the mistake, but it was frustrating when I wanted the lights to go in front of the mirror and not above it.",1,B,2017
"Very pretty, but the highlights are just a little too ""blue"" for our decor.",1,C,2018
Love it,1,D,2018
The purple is MUCH lighter...Had to return looking for dark purple,1,E,2018

"The tree is beautiful , the problem is making it stand up without screwing it to the floor or a bigger base . If it would be more stable i would have loved it .",1,H,2018
I did not care for the driftwood frame.  I would have liked it better with no frame at all.,1,I,2017
This print is perfect for my coastal living area! The colors are vibrant and exactly as pictured!,1,J,2018
Well-made. Color didn't work for me.,1,A,2018
"They are beautiful color and quality.  However, guess I didn't pay attention, You need to order three for each window to achieve this look that they show in the picture.",1,B,2017
"The seats are horrible. It was so rough in texture that I got slivers of wood in my hand just from rubbing my hand across!! This was the case with both seats. I'm sure it would snag clothing as well. I never even assembled them due to the seat being so bad. They were returned. 
Side note - they are cheaper elsewhere. See another review with photo of brand.",1,C,2018
Hermoso,1,D,2017
Great drape. Definitely transparent.,1,E,2018
Picture is deciving. Looks like black and silver,1,F,2018

"Not as pretty in person.  Ended up returning because looks ""Old"" and was for my teenage daughter.",1,H,2018
"Very plush, good color, and extremely soft!",1,I,2017

To big for my needs but a nice box.,1,A,2017
Love this rug.  Color is perfect and fits well with our modern design.   Was sent wrong size initially but was replaced quickly.,1,B,2017
This tablecloth is everything as described. Elegant look with the design and pattern. This is the second one I have purchased and I have been pleased. The only reason for the purchase of the second one was due to someone spilling red candle wax that created a large red stain. I was happy to find Wayfair still carried this tablecloth.,1,C,2018
Lovely,1,D,2017
"The Stool Are Beautiful But I Did Not Realized That 25"" Was To Short Of A Length For My Bar",1,E,2017
This looks great in my family room. It holds a tiffany lamp and the small size is perfect for a corner.,1,F,2017
love the color,1,G,2018
I don't recommend. They're not comfortable to step on. The design is raised so it's lumpy and the carpet doesn't lay flat. Strings pulled. For the price you can get something much nicer.,1,H,2018
"Just received the mirror and it was the wrong finish! :(  Was really looking forward to it.. Also the mirror itself is of very low quality as it makes a person look distorted , too wide and short!  Very dissapointed... guess you get what you pay for......I will continue to search for the leaning mirror im looking for...",1,I,2017
priced right,1,J,2018
"Really pretty, this rug brings a pop of color in the room. It's nor a good choice if you have a dog, dog hair just clings to it. After 8 months of high traffic use, it's a little worn, better for a low traffic accent",0,A,2018
It's attractive to look at not to difficult to assemble but it is supremely uncomfortable.   We'll keep it b/c we'll use it infrequently.,0,B,2017
I’ve named her Nancy. And I love her! So cute in person!,0,C,2017

"In the vast landscape of assemble it yourself furniture, this piece challenged my adequate handyman skills and so I called in reinforcements to help me finish the journey. This piece is best built with a friend, loved one, or someone you don't mind yelling at only to make up with over your favorite adult beverage later. It looks beautiful and is a daily reminder of my lack of patience in furniture assembly, which keeps me humble. I think that's called a win/win.",0,E,2017
Even prettier in person!  I used a dimmable filament bulb to complete the look.  I would highly recommend.,0,F,2018
Easy assembly less than 30 minutes,0,G,2018

"Pretty easy to put together, sturdy, and looks great. the wood is darker then the picture and my stand came without predrilled holes for the center wood backing so i have not put the back on. Other then that great purchase.",0,E,2018
"This is a beautiful pattern and covers ALL the ugly stains in the cheap w to w installed 20 years ago by the apt complex. They have refused to replace it or paint so I'm covering the cheap stuff with pretty stuff. The rug is not very thick, which I expected it to be. I grew up with Oriental rugs and love them. This is a decent immitation.",0,F,2018
"They are nice, but food gets trapped in the divots and they are extremely bulky. After a few weeks, threads are unraveling on one of them.",0,G,2018

"Very well made, great colors!",0,F,2017
I have always wanted one of these plants but never do well with live ones. This is very nice and I am very happy with this purchase. My sister in law came over and went up to it and even touched it lightly. She said how beautiful it was and that she new I wanted one. I had to tell her it was not real. She walked back over and touched it again. It is natural looking. I love this arrangement.,0,G,2018
Looks exactly like the picture. Fairly easy to assemble but it takes awhile.,0,H,2018
Great kit.,0,I,2018
Love everything about these perfect for the small space I have,0,J,2017
"I purchased this end table in Oak and received it early. It was fully assembled when it arrived in careful packaging. 

The table itself is very pretty. The magazine rack on the side is great. I can easily fit my journal and a legal pad portfolio on the bottom rack and in the top rack perfectly holds my chromebook and my kindle. The tray at the top has an area to put drinks and an area for remotes. I don't anticipate using the drink tray but I can still use the drink tray space to store other items (like my glasses cleaning wipes and styluses for my kindle).

The two drawers are sizeable and are about the size one would need to put in a legal pad with room left in the front and back, so they are long and the depth is reasonable. I put some pens and a computer mouse in one and some books in the other. 

I naturally accumulate clutter around the areas I spend time in and I purchased this to reduce clutter and have more table space. Because the tray, drawers, and rack all offer organization, the table itself only has a lamp and some tissues on it and it has made the area next to my chairs look much much better. 

I am very happy with this purchase and, if I would recommend this end table to friends and family.",0,A,2018
Love this! Assembly was not too difficult. Looks chic and matches with plenty of furniture themes. Able to fit extra storage beneath without being seen.,0,B,2017

This set is great! Not too big and not too small. Sturdy. The pieces are light and easy to assemble. The cushions are firm and almost white.,0,D,2017
"I think the Henna color is a really unusual red brown and does not absorb light like the dark brown
option and not as shiny as pitcured they are very comfortable and the swivel is great.  They are very nicely made except for the new zip on type upholstery which makes it impossible to get sharp edge on the top stitched seams because the foam is cut slightly larger. But they're so inexpensive compared to the perfectly upholstered ones that I purchased from Pier One five years ago that are no longer available and were twice the price of these.",0,E,2017
"I'm very pleased with this purchase. The table was well-packaged and easy to put together. It took me about 30 minutes. It is a heavy piece but I managed to slide it on a blanket and assemble by myself. With a helper, it would take maybe 15 minutes.",0,F,2018

"I've purchased quite a few shell-style mid-century chairs, and these are some of my favorites! The walnut legs are beautiful, and come with grip glides already attached. Assembly is a snap - just attach the leg assembly to the bottom of the shell chair. I purchased in the smoke-blue fabric, and was surprised that the upholstery on the inside seat and seat back of the chair is smoke-blue, but the outside seat back of the chair is actually a lighter version of that color. I don't mind it, but was surprised. I will be sure to post a photo for an example.",0,G,2018

Unfortunately it stopped working within an hour of being plugged in. Never fear, the Wayfair team was wonderful and all it took was a quick phone call and I had a replacement at my doorstep.

"Well I already have the purple mosaic bedding in my light purple bedroom and just love it. I've had more compliments that my sister had purchased the same thing to update her ""granddaughters room"". 
I have a coral color room that the pink/orange mosaic is going to look beautiful in. 
I really love the Jessica Simpson line - because it caters to both young and older girls alike- from age 3 (my great niece who wants the purple in her room- to my twin sister age 58 who is redecorating a room with it?!?)",0,D,2018

Nice color for small basement Windows,0,E,2018
Great quality . Everyone wants to know where I got this sink!!,0,F,2017
"The construction seems fine. The chair is really more square than it appears in this picture. My chief complaint, other than it was delivered over 3 weeks later than the estimate with no explanation as to why, is that the fumes from the chair are so bad that 2 days after delivery, I cannot sit in it. It gives me a headache and burning sensation in my nose and throat. The company that makes the chair, Klaussner, claims they use low VOC materials. I'm having a hard time believing that.",0,G,2017

Easy to put together although we did use some Gorilla wood glue to help put it together though the instructions didn't call for it.   They look great, are sturdy but not too heavy to move.   Very pleased.",0,H,2018
Very pretty headboard and easy to assemble. Arrived quickly and well packaged.,0,I,2017

Looks great! Just as pictured!,0,G,2018
This dresser could be nice if the screws sent with the dresser were actually long enough to keep the tracks attached to the drawers themselves. I'm very disappointed in this product because I just wanted a nice dresser. I wouldn't recommend buying this dresser unless you are fine with going to a hardware store and buying equipment to assemble this properly.,0,H,2017
Love these...got them in the blue.,0,I,2017
I like them so far,0,J,2018

"Works for me, looks great!",0,H,2017
Love it just the right size for a small area!! Very comfortable!,0,I,2018
"I liked the slip cover material.  The material is very soft and comfortable to sit on.  The hassock cover fit perfectly, the upper chair, took a lot of tucking.  The t-cushion slipcover fit perfectly too.  The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the top part didn't have as smooth a fit as the other parts of the chair.  All in all, though, I am very satisfied with these slip covers.",0,J,2017
very cute,0,A,2017
Nice quality. Happy with this purchase,0,B,2017

"This was a bit of a project to put together so plan accordingly.  There are many pieces.  Once assembled, however, it works perfectly for our purposes.  The cabinet doors are a little tricky to adjust for smooth operation.",0,D,2018
We love the size of these chairs and they look very nice in our living room.  The delivery was fast and efficient.  The pillows that came with the chairs are the only negative...They started to unravel the moment we took them out of the package.  Not a big deal for us as we don't use them anyways.,0,E,2017
Best price around!,0,F,2017

"I don't think we could be any happier with this stand. I needed a corner stand that was functional (space for the TV and the electronics), easy to clean (I hate dusting) and added a touch of charm to our living space. The rustic look to this stand change the vibe just enough without making it look like I needed to replace the end tables. Blends perfectly with our grey furniture and our grey/tan/brown area rug. And it was fairly easy to assemble (I'd give it a six on a scale of one to ten, ten being complicated and time consuming).",0,E,2017
Just what I thought it would be like. Really easy assembly!,0,F,2018
"nice , nice",0,G,2018

Their re auto fill. Hang nicely and are a beautiful cream linen.,0,I,2018
"I ordered 3 of these in oil rubbed bronze for a client and they have a great finish, good weight, real metal. I ordered the large size according to their measurements listed and even asked the minimum size the rod would go down to b
ut when they arrived I couldn't use the long extension piece at all which makes me think that I could have ordered the smaller size and saved money. I did have one bracket that needed to fit on the outer extension rod (which has to be slightly larger in diameter so that the extending section can slide into it) but didn't. I made it work but less than perfect. The other two rods came with 2 slightly larger diameter brackets and one slightly smaller diameter bracket which is the correct number & size you need.",0,J,2018
Thin and flimsy - very basic toss-away after a few months set.,0,A,2018
Very cute for the holidays!,0,B,2018

"This is nothing what I expected, I was.not sure about it at first when I opened the box.. My tile.is very dark and I wanted something different to brighten it up and I also needed a.rug that was dog friendly.  Its very modern and.some would.consider it garage type looking. I put it by my sink and dishwasher. This rug is a very shiny silver not grey as I expected. I love it changed the entire appearance of my kitchen I bought the long runner and so glad I spent the money on it. I would highly recommend this plush new modern for any kitchen.",0,C,2017
So soft and cuddly,0,D,2018
I'm loving it. Goes with two chairs previously purchased. A little tricky putting together but well packaged for each step. Hint: put the bottom slats on first before assembling the rest.,0,E,2017
Loved the glam look. Thank You because could not find anything like it. Beautiful. Quality is excellent.,0,F,2017
Bought this in a King size Bed. The back legs are thin for as big as the bed is. Looks good and was easy to assemble but not sure how long it will last because of the quality.,0,G,2017
Love the bed. Been looking forever and this was a price I could not pass up. Seems really sturdy. Enough for two humans and three dogs. One being a Great Dane,0,H,2017

So pretty and realistic looking.,0,A,2017

"I purchased this vase as a bathroom waste basket.  The height and circumference keeps my dog from being able to trash dig.  Anyway, it is light weight and has a very nice modern appeal.",0,C,2017
I really like the rug plus has no-skid backing. The beauty and price sold it to me.,0,D,2018

Soft,0,B,2017
Very warm,0,C,2018
Perfect fit.,0,D,2018
These look really nice but the cushions need more cushion. They are super thin with not much padding. I am not fat nor are my friends and they still flatten out. I will have to invite some fat person over to sit on the cushions to see if it survives. The bases are fine though.,0,E,2018
Waiting on it now. The biggest one ive seen yet look forward to using it. GOT IT FOR OVER HALF OFF,0,F,2018
The second one that you sent was great. Working nicely in the kitchen.,0,G,2018
"Very pleased with this vanity—I would definitely buy again. Solid, firm structure, with beautiful ceramic top. Plenty of space in the drawers and cabinet. I've switched out the faucet, as the chrome doesn't match the rest of the bathroom. Overall: very modern, clean lines. Makes a positive statement.",0,H,2017
I love love them,0,I,2017
Great! Super easy to assemble and does exactly what we need it to do.,0,J,2018

I love it! My cats love it! Well priced and the craftsmanship is  superb; even got it in blue to match the surrounding decor.,0,D,2018
"Its a perfect size and looks just like the pictures. The glass top is very thick and heavy, both indicators of good quality and I believe will be durable.",0,E,2017
I think it should have 2 of the small rotating brushes not just 1 but it works pretty well for my small space,0,F,2017

Nice and elegant. Like it a lot!,0,G,2018
"I kept th above to use as forms for pillow covers. Color poor and poorly stuffed.

"This table is well made and easy to put together. The drawers catch when you open them and are small, but I don't really use them anyway. I changed the pulls to black, which was easy. Great for the price!",0,A,2017
Perfect!!!,0,B,2017
"The color is not as shown...it's more cream than white, so it does not match the table I purchased.  It is, though, a solid stool that was very easy to assemble myself!",0,C,2018
It is a beautiful design and my son loves it.,0,D,2017
perfect!,0,E,2018

Love the set... instructions not very well done... looks great though,0,H,2017
Perfect! From ordering to delivery the process was skating rink smooth. And the product matched the picture. Did I mention the price was less than I had planned to spend.,0,I,2018
"It's pretty much just what I expected from the picture/description, just what I was looking for. It's not too flimsy or cheap feeling. My only issue is I haven't been able to get it level but I'm still adjusting it to get it right.",0,J,2017
Perfect. Sturdy. Well constructed. Had them put together in 5 minutes. Impressive,0,A,2017
Vertical supports are a bit wobbly. Hammered in some wooden shims and it did the trick.,0,B,2018
Great rug,0,C,2018

Comfy and looks good!,0,J,2018
Smaller than I thought,0,A,2018

First memory foam pillow I ever purchased and it will be my last. Too hard and flatter than expected. Will keep as a back support when I sit up in bed to watch TV.,0,C,2017
The pillows were exactly what I was expecting!,0,D,2018
beautiful when lit or off,0,E,2017
"I should have paid attention to the height as it is a little short for my space. Otherwise, it serves a nice purpose.",0,F,2017
gorgeous,0,G,2018
Love this light but one of the white light covers sat crooked due to the arm welded a little crooked. Had to adjust it ourselves to make it straight.  Otherwise looks nice,0,H,2018
Excellent---love it!,0,I,2018
gorgeous frame! ordered two!,0,J,2018

Love the tables. Just wish the yellow was a little more muted. Will probably antique them with black wax.,0,D,2017

great quality,0,F,2018
I looks better than sheets over my furniture.  It does a nice job protecting my chair.  Would recommend.,0,G,2017
No complaints it's does its job.,0,H,2017
"Ohhhh, how I love this bar stool. The walnut finish is very rich, and our teal upholstery is beautiful. I just wish the workmanship were a bit more consistent, because only one of our three barstools is just right (I feel like Goldilocks!!). One barstool has pretty significant wrinkles/imperfections in the seat padding/upholstery, and on the other one the curved wood veneer has obvious seams (the wood doesn't meet quite properly). Easy to put together, though, and the adjustable seat height and swivel functions are flawless.",0,I,2018
I really like the stool.  We wanted a shorter one to use around the coffee table when we needed some extra seating for guests.  This one is the perfect size and weight.  It's actually heavier than I thought it would be.  It's really a awesome stool!,0,J,2017
Nice quality for the price! The curtains are lined and and the color looks like the picture.,0,A,2018
I love it,0,B,2017
